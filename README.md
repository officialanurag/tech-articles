# tech-articles

Welcome to my repository, where I share the code samples accompanying my technical articles. Each folder here is named after an article and contains practical examples to illustrate the concepts, tools, and technologies discussed. These samples are designed for anyone eager to deepen their understanding through hands-on experience, from beginners to seasoned developers.

## Repository Organization

- **Article-named directories**: The root of the repository houses directories, each corresponding to a specific article. Inside these directories, you'll find code samples related to that article. The directory and the article share the same name for easy reference.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Select an Article**: Start by choosing an article of interest. Each article's concepts are demonstrated by the code samples in the corresponding directory.
2. **Explore the Code**: Navigate to the article-named directory in this repository to find the code samples. 
3. **Experiment**: Download or clone the repository, run the samples, and modify them. Experimentation is encouraged to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
4. **Combine Theory with Practice**: Read the article alongside exploring the code samples for a comprehensive learning experience.
